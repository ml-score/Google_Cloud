### Binary Classification


* **GCP - 001 - Basic Big Query Operations.ipynb** - some basic data operations to prepare the sample data. Also might give some insights into how bigframes does work
* **GCP - 010 - XGBoost Binary Classification and Bigframes.ipynb** - the creation of the model itself. Store it in your Google cloud project and re-use it on new data

### Regression
